## Sprint 66 Report

### 1. Executive Summary

Sprint 66 ran from June 24, 2025, to July 7, 2025. The sprint aimed to deliver features and bug fixes across Web, Android, iOS, and Backend platforms. While a significant amount of work was completed, some tickets remain in "Doing" status. The overall health can be considered "At Risk" due to incomplete tasks by the end of the sprint.

    *The Web team exceeded its planned build and run capacity, but one task is still in progress.

*   **Android:**
    *   Planned Build Capacity: 54 hours
    *   Delivered Build: 8 + 12 + 16 + 7.5 + 4 + 8 + 3 + 2 = 60.5 hours (WIN-5945, WIN-5926, WIN-5768, WIN-5931, WIN-5915, WIN-6011, WIN-6046, WIN-6016)
    * Remaining Build: 16 hours (WIN-5774)
    *   Planned Run Capacity: 10 hours
    *   Delivered Run: 1 + 1 + 2.5 = 4.5 hours (WIN-5910, WIN-5282, WIN-5931-R)
    *The Android team exceeded its planned build capacity and delivered under its planned run capacity. One task is still in progress.

### 3. Highlights & Achievements

*   The Android team completed significant work on the mobile app refactoring, delivering tasks like WIN-5945 ([android][Navigation][Refonte app mobile] Nouveau Header) and WIN-5926 ([android][Navigation][Refonte app mobile] Bloc mes lignes).
*   The Backend team successfully implemented interceptors to prevent duplicate cart creation (WIN-6002, WIN-6003).
*   The Web team addressed several UI issues and implemented improvements to the payments section (WIN-4869, WIN-4764, WIN-4767, WIN-4890).
*   The iOS team delivered key features related to dashboard enhancements (WIN-5968, WIN-5769, WIN-5927, WIN-5946).

### 4. Challenges & Learnings

*   Several tasks were not completed by the end of the sprint (WIN-5774, WIN-5775, WIN-5763, WIN-4852). This suggests potential challenges with estimation accuracy or unexpected roadblocks during development. Based on historical data, a similar situation occurred in the previous sprint where tasks were still in progress at the end of the sprint, indicating a recurring issue.
*   Several tasks were marked as out of scope: WIN-5915, WIN-5968, WIN-6004, WIN-6011, WIN-4890, WIN-5053, WIN-6010, WIN-6046, WIN-6016, WIN-4852. This shows some scope creep. 

### 5. Recommendations

*   **Improve Estimation Accuracy:** Conduct a retrospective specifically focused on estimation accuracy to identify patterns and refine the estimation process. Review the "Doing" tickets to understand why they weren't completed.
*   **Refine Sprint Planning:** During sprint planning, ensure tasks are well-defined and dependencies are clearly identified. This might involve breaking down larger tasks into smaller, more manageable units.
*   **Monitor Sprint Progress More Closely:** Implement daily stand-ups or more frequent check-ins to identify and address potential roadblocks early on. Consider using a Kanban board to visualize workflow and identify bottlenecks.
*   **Scope Management:** Improve scope management to avoid scope creep. If a task is out of scope, add to the backlog.
